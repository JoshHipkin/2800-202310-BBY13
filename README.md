Conrad_MainLoginSignupBasicPages:
Basic front end crucial pages to get the project started. Implemented bootstrap to give the pages
a little more front end detail. I also created a template.html to copy for other pages. I only created 
the pages with basic content but I didn't connect each page though an index.js as we did in COMP 2537.

(May 9, 2023)
- Created index, login and signup html pages
- Created footer and header html in templates folder
- Created navHeaderFooter.js to read and load footer and header templates into pages.
- Implemented Bootstrap and Jquery to get the header and footer to appear
- Created template.html to copy for other pages to keep consistency
